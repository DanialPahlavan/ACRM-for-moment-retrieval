# ACRM-for-moment-retrieval

This is the repository of our paper.

For now, only the testing model and the corresponding code is available. We will release the whole project once the paper is accepted.

The pretrained models are provided for [Charades-STA](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1u_MvZA2yG7hI1VvAXmWLeA) and TaCoS.

The extracted I3D features for [TaCoS](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11QQvGoXB0LkDPEHbj9bWKA) and for [Charades-STA](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1KpZI0JT0zGbmX1IRlTAVow) is  provided for both of them.

The above models and features are stored in Baiduyun disk, where the extraction key is **th08** for all of them.

The pre-trained glove embedding that we use is [glove.840B.300d.zip](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) trained with the Common Crawl (840B tokens, 2.2M vocab, cased, 300d vectors, 2.03 GB download).

The code is based on https://github.com/crodriguezo/TMLGA. And thanks to their features.
